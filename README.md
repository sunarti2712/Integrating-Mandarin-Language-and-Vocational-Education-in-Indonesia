# Integrating-Mandarin-Language-and-Vocational-Education-in-Indonesia

This study develops and validates an integrated “Mandarin + Vocational Education” model designed to bridge the competency gap between Indonesian vocational school graduates and the needs of Chinese-invested industries. Using a Research and Development (R&D) design, the study conducted an industry-driven needs analysis through interviews, workplace observations, surveys, and job-market coding, resulting in a Technical–Linguistic Competency Matrix that maps key technical tasks to workplace Mandarin functions. The model was subsequently designed using a task-based curriculum framework, developed into instructional modules and assessment tools, and validated by experts, yielding a high Content Validity Index (CVI = 0.91). A pilot implementation involving 217 students demonstrated significant improvement in Mandarin workplace proficiency and technical task performance (paired t-test, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d > 1.0), supported by positive evaluations from teachers and industry supervisors. The findings confirm that the integrated model is feasible, relevant to industry needs, and effective in enhancing both technical and linguistic readiness. This study contributes a replicable and evidence-based model for strengthening TVET–language integration and improving workforce preparedness in the Chinese–Indonesian industrial sectors.
